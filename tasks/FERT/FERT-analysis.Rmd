title: "FERT analysis"
output: html_notebook
---

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Execute chunks by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

NOTE: Not sure is a R Notebook is the correct format for what we want (for example, it doesn't render on github - see https://github.com/rstudio/rmarkdown/issues/1020). Maybe R Markdown is more appropriate??

NOTE: For script to run you need to do the following:
    - Type the following into your R console: 
            install.packages("devtools")
    - Then type the following into your R console:
            devtools::install_github('CenterForOpenScience/osfr')



```{r}
# Preamble
rm(list = ls(all.names = TRUE))

library(osfr) 
library(pracma)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
# Set directory
root <- getwd()
print(root)
```


Get your personal access token (PAT) from OSF: 

Below process generated from: https://developer.osf.io/#tag/Authentication and https://pastebin.com/UZ4ZnzaC 

1. Go to your OSF page > settings > Personal access tokens > Create token 
2. Give the token the name "R-analysys". Tick "osf.full_read" > Create token
3. Copy the token and save it in the same directory as this code. Use the file name "osf_token_read.txt"
IMPORTANT NOTE: The token must be saved in this directory and with this name to ensure it is captured by the .gitignore and not pushed to the git repository.

```{r}
# Authorise your access token
osf_auth(token = read_lines("osf_token_read.txt"))
```

guid_mainProj <- 'sxzmv' 
#pull the data and store it
# get each component in the project
data_mainProj <- osf_retrieve_node(guid_mainProj)
#print(data_mainProj,n=Inf)
